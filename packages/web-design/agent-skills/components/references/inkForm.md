# InkForm

## Rationale

A form container component that provides consistent layout context for form controls.

## Goals

Provide a form wrapper that automatically configures child form controls (InkInput, InkTextarea, InkPicker) to use InkField for consistent field layouts.

## Specification

A form container that uses Vue's provide/inject API to communicate layout preferences to child form controls. Form controls inside InkForm will automatically wrap themselves with InkField.

## Implementation

### Props

- `layout` (`"inline" | "col" | "row"`, `"col"`): The default layout for all form fields inside this form

### Events

- `submit(e: Event)`: Emitted when the form is submitted

### Slots

- `default`: The form content (form controls, buttons, etc.)

### Context

The component provides `INK_FORM_CONTEXT_KEY` context that child form controls can inject to detect they are inside a form and access the default layout.

## Props

```typescript
export const inkFormProps = {
  layout: makeStringProp<FieldLayout>("col"),
} as const;
```

## Events

```typescript
export const inkFormEmits = {
  submit: (e: Event) => true,
} as const;
```

## Types

```typescript
interface InkFormContext {
  layout: FieldLayout;
}
```

## Import

```typescript
import { inkForm } from '@inkcre/web-design';
```
